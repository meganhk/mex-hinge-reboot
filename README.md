Hi! This is a project that I created as a joke for my friends to rank + judge my Hinge profile as I recently broke up with my long term partner.

This repo is newly created, which is why there's not much history, just because I wanted to clear up the messy git push history if I was going to make the repo public for my profile.

I'm in the process of adding notes to each of the files so others can understand what's going on. Again, this wasn't included originally as I had no plans on making the repo public!

If you spot any way I can improve on this, pleaseeeeee email me (mexie.kh@gmail.com). I'd love to hear your advice, especially when it comes to integrating a strong backend.
